features:
    - icon: 🎯
      title: Actions-First Architecture
      details: UI components never call transport directly. All writes route through Actions that orchestrate writes, emit events, invalidate caches, and queue jobs.

    - icon: 📦
      title: Typed Resources
      details: Define REST contracts once, get typed client + store + cache keys + events. One definition for your entire data layer.

    - icon: 🔌
      title: Block Bindings & Interactivity
      details: Bind core WordPress blocks to your data. Add behavior with the Interactivity API. No custom blocks needed for most use cases.

    - icon: 🎪
      title: Canonical Event Taxonomy
      details: Stable, versioned event system. JS hooks are canonical, PHP bridge mirrors selected events only. No ad-hoc event names.

    - icon: ⚡
      title: Background Jobs
      details: Enqueue long-running tasks with polling support. Built-in status tracking and automatic retries with exponential backoff.

    - icon: 🛡️
      title: Type-Safe & Tested
      details: TypeScript strict mode, JSON Schema validation, structured error handling (KernelError), and comprehensive E2E tests.

## Why WP Kernel?

WordPress has gone JS-first (Blocks, Interactivity, Script Modules), but teams still lose time wiring state, data, and glue per project. **WP Kernel gives you a clear path forward.**

### For Developers

- **Scaffold → Ship**: Generate features with resources, actions, views, and tests—no yak-shaving
- **Predictable State**: One store model (`@wordpress/data`) with resolvers & cache lifecycle
- **Extensibility Without Fear**: Single event taxonomy and SlotFill extension points

### For Product Teams

- **Shorter Lead Times**: Less boilerplate, more features
- **Lower Risk**: Typed REST contracts + versioning + deprecations
- **Future-Proof**: Built on official WordPress primitives; benefit as Core evolves

## The Golden Path

1. **Actions-First**: All writes go through Actions (enforced by lint + runtime)
2. **Resources**: Define your data contract once (typed, cached, versioned)
3. **Views**: Blocks with bindings (data in) and interactivity (behavior out)
4. **Events**: JS hooks are canonical; PHP listens through one mirrored bridge

## Quick Example

```typescript
// 1. Define a resource
export const thing = defineResource<Thing>({
	name: 'thing',
	routes: {
		list: { path: '/wpk/v1/things', method: 'GET' },
		create: { path: '/wpk/v1/things', method: 'POST' },
	},
	schema: import('../../contracts/thing.schema.json'),
});

// 2. Write an action
export const CreateThing = defineAction('Thing.Create', async ({ data }) => {
	const created = await thing.create(data);
	CreateThing.emit(events.thing.created, { id: created.id, data });
	invalidate(['thing', 'list']);
	return created;
});

// 3. Use in UI
import { CreateThing } from '@/app/actions/Thing/Create';

const handleSubmit = async () => {
	await CreateThing({ data: formData });
};
```
