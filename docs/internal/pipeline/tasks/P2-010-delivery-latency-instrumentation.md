# P2-010: Instrument Pipeline delivery latency

## Objective

Explain the elapsed-time gap between an early working implementation and final
delivery using phase and process evidence, then remove avoidable orchestration
and repository-gate delay without weakening qualification.

This task is operational and does not block the Pipeline v2 release chain.

## Known evidence to preserve

- Independent semantic and documentation review began after implementation
  rather than alongside it.
- Broad formatting and Task Graph schema repair occurred after the code patch.
- The P2-013 commit hook spent roughly one minute in staged linting because
  `normalize-punctuation.js` ignored the filenames supplied by `lint-staged`,
  scanned all repository Markdown and rewrote 472 generated API files across
  4,170 changed lines.
- CPU-heavy lint and test gates were run concurrently, creating invalid timeout
  failures and requiring a serial rerun.
- On 2026-08-18, the root lint gate took 13 minutes 10 seconds with three of
  nine package tasks cached. Active ESLint workers included `core`, `cli`, `ui`
  and `wp-json-ast`; the final `cli` worker alone remained active for more than
  12 minutes.
- Root source and test typechecks took approximately 2 minutes 20 seconds and
  2 minutes 46 seconds respectively with no diagnostics.
- Parallel root test runs produced load-sensitive CLI fixture timeouts in both
  sandbox and host contexts. A host `--runInBand` run passed 419 suites and
  2,814 tests in 11 minutes 26 seconds.

## Acceptance criteria

- Record wall-clock timestamps for discovery, implementation, independent
  review, reconciliation, focused qualification, repository qualification,
  commit and push.
- Record each gate's wall time, cache state, host or sandbox context, process
  fan-out and peak concurrency.
- Establish uncontended baselines for formatting, documentation build, lint,
  source typecheck, test typecheck and tests.
- Separate repository execution cost from agent sequencing, approval waits,
  tool polling and repeated work.
- Identify which gates are required before review, before commit and before
  push, and which can safely run concurrently.
- Produce a concrete reduction plan with before-and-after timings while
  preserving the packed NodeNext consumer and release contract.
- Register a non-mutating `pipeline.delivery-latency` Task Graph command with
  the measured serial and safe-concurrent gate schedules once the benchmark
  script exists.

## Verification

Commit the raw timing ledger, process samples, command outcomes and the proposed
gate schedule. Re-run one representative Pipeline change through the revised
schedule and compare total elapsed time and failure quality.

Suggested execution tier: fast instrumentation with balanced review.
