# Pipeline v2 programme

Architecture version: 1
Task contract version: 1
Target package version: 2.0.0

This directory is the internal engineering authority for Pipeline v2. Public
documentation continues to describe the released v1 contract until v2 exists
and qualifies as a packed artefact.

The programme starts from an explicit correction: Pipeline v1 validates and
topologically orders helper dependencies, then executes a serial transformation
chain inside a sequential stage programme. It is not yet a dataflow DAG.

- [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) shows programme dependencies and external release
  lanes. Task front matter owns lifecycle state.
- [`EXTERNAL-LANES.md`](EXTERNAL-LANES.md) records non-blocking Task Graph and
  llm-core evidence without pretending this repository owns their state.
- [`COORDINATION.md`](COORDINATION.md) defines safe parallel execution.
- [`decisions/`](decisions/) records accepted semantic boundaries.
- [`contracts/`](contracts/) contains versioned implementation contracts.
- [`tasks/`](tasks/) contains the executable work briefs.

Three boundaries are non-negotiable:

1. The compiled graph is the execution authority. Nodes do not schedule the
   remainder of the graph.
2. Dataflow values are immutable. Concurrency cannot derive meaning from
   settlement timing.
3. Pipeline remains a process-local evaluator. Durable admission, leases,
   retries, journals, process supervision and external-effect idempotency
   belong to its host.

The current 1.4.x package remains supported while v2 is built beside it. V2 is
a major version, not a silent reinterpretation of `dependsOn`, `next(output?)`,
extensions or pause snapshots.
